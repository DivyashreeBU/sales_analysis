Live Sales Intelligence System:
This project simulates real-time sales data using Python and streams it into a CSV file, which is visualized in Power BI for dynamic business intelligence. It enables live tracking of metrics like revenue, returns, customer ratings, and fulfillment performance across platforms and districts.

How to execute:
- Download the folder and extract it 
- Open the Terminal with respect to that project directory and execute command python app.py
- Enter the details and click on Submit
- Open the Power BI and refresh to see the appended data
- If data file or csv file is not present in power BI then first upload the csv file
  
Potential Upgrades & Integrations:
- Database Integration: Replace the CSV backend with a relational database like SQL Server or PostgreSQL. This enables DirectQuery in Power BI for real-time updates and supports more complex queries, indexing, and data integrity.
- User Authentication & Role Management: Introduce login functionality using Flask-Login to track submissions by user, restrict access to certain features, and enable audit trails for enterprise use.
- Dynamic Form Intelligence: Enhance the form with predictive logicâ€”such as auto-suggesting fulfillment time based on category or flagging anomalies in conversion rate or returns.
- Live Dashboard in Flask: Embed real-time charts and KPIs directly into the Flask interface using Chart.js or Plotly Dash, allowing users to visualize trends immediately after submission.
- Machine Learning Insights: Incorporate basic ML models to forecast sales, detect outliers, or recommend optimal ad spend based on historical data.
- Unified Sales Analysis for Operational Efficiency: Analyzing sales data within a unified platform streamlines decision-making by reducing fragmentation and manual effort. It enhances purchasing efficiency by revealing actionable trends and optimizing inventory, pricing, and campaign strategies in real time.
